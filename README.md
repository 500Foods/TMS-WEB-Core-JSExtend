# TMS-WEB-Core-JSExtend

This repository contains the complete source code for a Delphi package consisting of components designed for use within TMS WEB Core projects.  These components are wrappers (mostly) for popular JavaScript libraries. The first such component, a wrapper for [FlatPickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/), was first published along with the TMS Softwware blog post that relates to it, on May 17, 2022.

If you find this repository useful to your work, or that it has saved you time or effort when it comes to crafting a better TMS WEB Core project, please consider supporting my efforts via "[Buy Me A :pizza:](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/andrewsimard500)".
