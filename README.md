# TMS-WEB-Core-JSExtend

This repository primarily contains a Delphi package consisting of components that are generally just wrappers for various JavaScript libraries.  The first such component, a wrapper for FlatPickr, was first published as a companion to the TMS Softwware blog post , published on May 17, 2022.

If you have ideas for improvements to any of the Examples or would like some examples of other functionality using JSON within TMS WEB Core projects, or if you find issues with any of the examples posted, by all means please post an Issue or a Discussion item.

If you find this repository useful to your work or that it has saved you time or effort when it comes to crafting a better TMS WEB Core project, please consider supporting my efforts via "[Buy Me A :pizza:](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/andrewsimard500)".
